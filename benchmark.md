# Benchmark: NeuroHTTP AI Web Server vs NGINX 1.29.3

**Test Environment:**  
- OS: Kali Linux  
- CPU: 4 threads  
- Connections: 100 concurrent  
- Test Duration: 30 seconds per server  
- Tool: `wrk -t4 -c100 -d30s --latency`

## 1. Summary of Results

| Server   | Requests/sec | Total Requests | Avg Latency | p50   | p75     | p90      | p99       | Max Latency | Transfer/sec |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------|-------|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| nginx    | 6743         | 202,701        | 80ms        | 11.79ms | 13.23ms | 218.75ms | 1.12s    | 1.33s       | 1.02MB       |
| NeuroHTTP   | 1621         | 48,762         | 61.22ms     | 43.08ms | 100.72ms | 104.62ms | 114.27ms | 135.85ms    | 4.94MB       |

## 2. Throughput Analysis

- **NGINX** achieved **6743 requests/sec**, approximately 4× higher than AIONIC.  
- **NeuroHTTP** handled **1621 requests/sec**, with each request transferring more data (higher Transfer/sec).  
- The lower throughput in AIONIC is expected due to internal processing (AI routing, tokenization, caching, and optimization).

## 3. Latency Analysis

| Server  | Avg Latency | p50   | p75     | p90      | p99       | Max Latency |
|---------|------------|-------|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| nginx   | 80ms       | 11.79ms | 13.23ms | 218.75ms | 1.12s    | 1.33s       |
| NeuroHTTP  | 61.22ms    | 43.08ms | 100.72ms | 104.62ms | 114.27ms | 135.85ms    |

**Observations:**
- NGINX shows very low latency for most requests (p50 = 11.79ms), but has large spikes at p90/p99 (up to 1.12s).  
- NeuroHTTP demonstrates **stable and predictable latency**, with p99 at 114.27ms and Max latency at 135.85ms.  
- Standard deviation confirms this: NGINX (207ms) vs AIONIC (38ms), indicating AIONIC handles requests more consistently under load.

## 4. Data Transfer

- **NeuroHTTP**: 4.94MB/sec → each request delivers more content.  
- **NGINX**: 1.02MB/sec → smaller content per request.  
- This explains why NeuroHTTP has fewer requests/sec but higher throughput in terms of data served per second.

## 5. Strengths of Each Server

| Server   | Strengths |
|----------|-----------|
| **NGINX** | - Extremely high throughput (6743 requests/sec)<br>- Ideal for static content (HTML/CSS/JS)<br>- Handles high concurrency efficiently<br>- Lightweight and widely adopted |
| **NeuroHTTP** | - Stable and predictable latency (p99 = 114ms)<br>- Handles dynamic/AI-processed content<br>- Higher data transfer per request (good for large payloads)<br>- Built-in cache and optimizer reduce performance fluctuations |

---

## 6. Conclusion

- **NGINX** excels in **raw speed** and handling a massive number of requests per second. It is perfect for static content and high-concurrency environments.  
- **NeuroHTTP** provides **predictable latency and stability**, optimized for dynamic content and AI-based processing. Although its throughput is lower, it is better suited for applications where consistent response time and heavier payloads matter.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Use **NGINX** as a front-facing server for static content or as a reverse proxy.  
- Use **NeuroHTTP** for dynamic AI-driven endpoints where latency stability and data-rich responses are more critical than raw request throughput.
