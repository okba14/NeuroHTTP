> **"Redefining how AI APIs communicate with the web — built from scratch in C and Assembly."**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**NeuroHTTP** (codename: *AIMux*) is a next-generation web server **purpose-built for AI workloads**.

Unlike traditional servers such as Nginx, Apache, or Node.js, which were not optimized for AI’s unique I/O and data flow, **NeuroHTTP** is designed from the ground up to handle:

- 🧠 **AI streaming responses** (like ChatGPT’s long token-by-token replies)  
- 📦 **Massive JSON payloads** and recurrent API calls  
- ⚡ **Concurrent AI model routing** across multiple endpoints  
- 🔌 **Real-time communication** using HTTP/3, WebSockets, and gRPC  

**Goal:** Create the world’s first **AI-native web server** capable of serving real-time, high-throughput AI inference APIs efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

- 🔥 **No direct competitors** exist for AI-optimized web servers today.  
- 🧩 **Built in C and Assembly**, outperforming Node.js, Python, and Go under load.  
- 🌍 **The AI API economy is exploding** (OpenAI, HuggingFace, LangChain, etc.).  
- 🧑‍💻 **Open-source friendly**, enabling a developer community to grow around it.  
- ⚙️ **Designed for scale**, both in terms of concurrency and extensibility.

## 🧠 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The first version focuses on simplicity and raw performance.

### ✅ Features
- Handles `HTTP POST` requests at `/v1/chat`
- Accepts JSON body containing `{ "prompt": "..." }`
- Responds with `{ "response": "Hello, AI world!" }`
- Supports **chunked streaming responses**
- Easily testable via `curl`

### 🧪 Example
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat -d '{"prompt":"Hello"}'
```
Expected output:

### json
{"response": "Hello, AI world!"}
# 🚧 Roadmap
Phase	Description
Phase 1	Core HTTP server with streaming responses
Phase 2	WebSocket support for AI streaming
Phase 3	Optimized C/ASM JSON Parser
Phase 4	Modular Plug-in System for custom extensions
Phase 5	Open-source release with detailed benchmarks vs Nginx

# 📊 Benchmark Goals (Planned)
* Server	1K concurrent requests	Avg Latency	Memory (MB)
* NeuroHTTP (C/ASM)	✅ Target: 2ms	🚀	< 10
* Nginx	~8ms	⚡	12
* Node.js (Express)	~15ms	🐢	60
* Flask (Python)	~30ms	🐢	120

# 💡 Vision
* The web was built for documents.
* Then came applications.
* Now it’s time for AI.

NeuroHTTP aims to redefine how AI models are served at scale, providing a native AI transport layer that’s fast, flexible, and open.

# 🧩 Example Use Cases
* Running AI chat models with streaming responses (like GPT, Claude, Mistral)

* Hosting LangChain or LLM orchestration pipelines

* Serving gRPC-based AI inference APIs

* Building multi-model routers for AI backends

# 🌍 Open Source Impact
Releasing NeuroHTTP on GitHub under the MIT License will attract:

Developer communities on Reddit, Hacker News, and GitHub

Early adoption by AI startups needing real-time serving

Collaboration similar to what happened with Caddy, Envoy, and Nginx

# 🔧 Installation (Soon)
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/yourname/neurohttp.git
cd neurohttp
make
./neurohttp
```
